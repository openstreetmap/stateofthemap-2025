World-Map-Explorer is a web application that helps the visually impaired learn about the world and understand maps. It is a great pleasure to note that the application was developed by a group of students from the Computer Science Department of Sri Krishnapuram Government Engineering College in collaboration with Zendalona with support of OpenStreetMap Kerala Community.

This app, which can be used by both the visually impaired and the sighted, is based on the free software OpenStreetMap. This app describes the world based on audio cues with the help of a screen reader. Existing applications like Google Maps cannot be used with a keyboard. Therefore, the visually impaired cannot use map applications. They understand the structure of areas by swiping their hands through the lines and dots that stand out on the tactile map. They understand where a place is by waving their hands over the place name written in Braille.

But this has many limitations. It only provides a few details about the place. And it is difficult to carry it anywhere. That is why the Map World-Map-Explorer, which can be easily used from anywhere, is opening up new possibilities for visually impaired peoples.
