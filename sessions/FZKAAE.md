Using OpenStreetMap and GIS to Monitor Urban Sprawl, Forecast Building Demand, and Evaluate Urban Development Trends
This session initially presents a practical approach to equipping the Ministry of Lands, Housing, and Human Settlements Development (MLHHSD) staff in Tanzania with essential GIS skills for urban planning. By leveraging open-source tools and OpenStreetMap (OSM) data, state of map participants will learn how to analyze urban sprawl, forecast future building space needs, and evaluate trends in urban development and planning control.
Urban sprawl, characterized by uncontrolled city expansion, poses major challenges for sustainable development. Through spatial analysis, visualization, and modeling using tools like OSM, QGIS and spatial statistics, participants can identify growth hotspots, assess building density patterns, and measure the Urban Sprawl Index. The session also covers forecasting techniques using historical data and scenario modeling to project building demand and align infrastructure development with population trends.
Furthermore, GIS tools will be applied to evaluate long-term development trends, monitor the effectiveness of urban policies, and assess the environmental impact of expansion. Attendees will explore practical steps for implementation, including data collection strategies, interdepartmental collaboration, and stakeholder engagement. This session demonstrates how open data ecosystems like OSM and GIS can empower governments to make informed, future-oriented urban planning decisions

This session introduces how OpenStreetMap and GIS tools can be used to analyze urban sprawl, forecast building space needs, and evaluate urban development trends. Designed for planners and professionals at the Ministry of Lands, Housing, and Human Settlements Development (MLHHSD), the session emphasizes practical, hands-on applications of open-source tools such as QGIS. Participants will learn how to visualize urban growth, assess land use change, model future building demand, and evaluate the effectiveness of planning policies. The session will also explore how open data and collaborative mapping can support more informed, sustainable, and responsive urban development in Tanzania and similar contexts.
