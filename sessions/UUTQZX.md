In this talk I will describe the pros and cons of using the pmtiles vector tile format in comparison with other tile formats. I will then talk about some of the tools available to generate pmtiles tiles based on OSM data and other GIS formats, inspect these tiles and visualize them on a website. Finally, I will demonstrate how I built in the real world a data pipeline to filter and transform OSM data, combine it with other data from external sources, generate pmtiles using the tools previously described and implement a website to display the generated tiles on a map.
