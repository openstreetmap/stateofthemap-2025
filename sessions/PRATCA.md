Sri Lanka, as a tropical island nation, faces significant challenges including frequent climate related disasters such as floods, landslides, and droughts, alongside socio economic inequalities and limited access to digital infrastructure in many rural and underserved areas. OpenStreetMap (OSM) has become a transformative platform that enables communities to map their own environments, fostering resilience and advancing sustainable development goals through locally driven geospatial data creation and use.
This presentation delves into how community based mapping initiatives in Sri Lanka leverage OSM to empower vulnerable populations especially youth and women by providing training in digital literacy, data science, and geospatial technologies. These programs not only equip participants with valuable skills but also nurture a sense of ownership and agency in managing their environment. The integration of emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning enhances data accuracy and analysis, facilitating better planning for disaster risk reduction, infrastructure development, and natural resource management.

Drawing on specific case studies from rural flood-prone villages to urban areas engaging university youth through YouthMappers chapters, and successful examples of community collaboration, capacity building, and the use of tools like QGIS, Overpass API, and AI-powered satellite imagery analysis. It showcases how OSM maps produced by these communities serve as crucial resources for local authorities, NGOs, and disaster management agencies. Moreover, emphasizes the role of digital inclusion as a cornerstone for sustainable development, highlighting efforts to reduce the digital divide by improving access to mapping technology and data literacy. By fostering an ecosystem where open data meets inclusive education and participatory technology, Sri Lankan communities are crafting innovative pathways to resilience that transcend traditional development approaches.

This session presents a deep dive into how OpenStreetMap (OSM) is being used to empower communities across Sri Lanka to address climate challenges, promote digital inclusion, and support sustainable development. Participants will explore how community-based mapping projects are enabling youth, women, and underserved populations to develop practical skills in geospatial technologies and data literacy. Through hands on examples and case studies from flood-prone rural areas to urban university led YouthMappers chapters, the session demonstrates how participatory mapping fosters resilience, supports local planning, and enhances disaster preparedness.
Through this it helps to gain exposure to the integration of advanced tools such as QGIS, Overpass API, and AI-enhanced satellite imagery analysis. The session emphasizes how OSM initiatives are not just about creating maps, but about building capacity, improving decision-making, and creating inclusive spaces for local voices in development processes. Ideal for practitioners, researchers, and volunteers working in GIS, humanitarian response, or digital empowerment, it offers replicable strategies and inspiring insights from the Sri Lankan experience.
