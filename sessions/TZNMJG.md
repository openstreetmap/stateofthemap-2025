TomTom partners with OSM communities worldwide to build richer maps through collective action. In this SotM Global event 2025, we share how we support university mapathons, YouthMappers, and humanitarian mapping in 189 countries, reflecting on learnings and challenges in scaling community engagement while advancing OSM’s mission through meaningful, local partnerships.

TomTom and the OpenStreetMap Community share a common vision: building a map that reflects and serves the world, powered by local knowledge and collective action. In this session, We will be taking you behind the scenes of TomTom’s partnerships with OSM communities worldwide, demonstrating how collaborative efforts are strengthening the quality, freshness, and inclusiveness of OpenStreetMap data.
From hosting mapathons with universities and YouthMappers chapters to supporting humanitarian mapping during crises, TomTom’s initiatives have connected 3,397+ OSM contributors across 189 countries. We will share real examples of how these collaborations are transforming local mapping ecosystems while providing technical resources, training, and data that support contributors in making impactful edits.
We will also discuss scaling corporate-community collaborations responsibly, challenges faced in diverse regions, and opportunities for co-creating projects that benefit both OSM and local communities. Participants will leave with ideas and inspiration on how to replicate or adapt these approaches to engage more mappers, foster skill-building, and deepen OSM’s reach.
Join us to discover how mapping together can empower communities and create a richer, more inclusive map of the world.
