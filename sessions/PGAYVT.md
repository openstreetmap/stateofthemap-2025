This training session will show how to get started with JOSM editor from the very first steps after installation to some plugins and advanced features which makes it different from iD Editor.
The session will go through the following topics:
- Initial settings after JOSM download
- Basic editing modes in JOSM, how to change imagery, align it to the data, etc.
- How to download plugins in JOSM to enhance its functionalities
- Usage of plugins: utils, buildings, open_data, FastDraw, ToDo, revert. Some of these plugins are to map better and faster, while others are to perform validation of data
- JOSM queries to selected OSM data (very useful for validation)

The ideal participant to the session is a mapper that has some knowledge of OSM editing, always used iD editor and would like to get some exposure to JOSM to be able to perform some advanced mapping, or just explore it further. If that is you, do not hesitate to participate!
It is necessary for participants to bring their own laptop and mouse with JOSM already downloaded, possibly to the latest tested version which can be found here: https://josm.openstreetmap.de/wiki/Download.
