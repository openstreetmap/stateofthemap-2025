How does OpenStreetMap data as a collection of nodes, ways, and relations with tags like `highway=*`, `access=*` become the fast, turn-by-turn navigation and routing you see and use every day, including on `openstreetmap.org`?

And what else can you build and do with such a Routing Network?

This **beginner-friendly deep-dive** unpacks the **tag-to-routing network process* and compares today’s most prominent open-source routing engines (OSRM, GraphHopper, Valhalla, openrouteservice). 
On the example of openrouteservice we will show how currently 180,000 users, from governments to humanitarian responders, **turn raw OSM data into meaningful mobility analysis** using directions, isochrones and vehicle-route optimisation and how your contribution helps them do this. 

To round up the talk, we will focus on **current trends for routing engines** and look at two forthcoming and noteworthy developments in the openrouteservice ecosystem, that aim to **mitigate climate and humanitarian related challenges**.

<hr>

OpenStreetMap is the planet’s most detailed open-data street network. But how does a crowdsourced collection of `nodes`, `ways`, and `relations` become a routable Routing Network that you see on e.g. `openstreetmap.org`, and what can you do with it, once it has been built?

This session takes **newcomers and intermediates** on a **step-by-step journey to OSM-based mobility analysis**:

- **Tags → Routing Network**: Understand which OSM-data and tags like `highway=*`, `access=*`  are used for routing and how they influence e.g. turn-restrictions, speed estimations or surface data.
- **OSM-Community Impact**: Understand how your OSM edits and contributions can influence and enhance routing and mobility analysis.
- **Engines &amp; Algorithms**: A beginner-friendly look at today’s open routing engines (OSRM, GraphHopper, Valhalla, openrouteservice) and the algorithms they implement.
- **Mobility Analysis in Action**: Using insights from 180 000 openrouteservice users, we explore real-world cases from governments, social institutions and humanitarian organisations and learn how they use OSM to support their communities and goals.

-&gt; What comes next?

At the end of the talk, we will briefly explore the current trends in routing engines and look into two specific and noteworthy developments from openrouteservice:

- **Current trends**: What can we expect from open-source and OSM based routing engines next?
- **Graphs-on-demand**: High-quality graphs for openrouteservice, downloaded in minutes, bringing independent, unlimited and privacy-aware mobility analysis. Reduce your preprocessing time, storage, and energy usage and use pre-computed routing networks for any place on earth.
- **Dynamic-data optimisation**: Learn about new routing algorithm research from HeiGIT that allows the ingestion of field data to reroute critical humanitarian deliveries in near-real-time.

By the end of this talk, you will have a more profound understanding of what open-source routing is. You will understand how your involvement in OSM, mapping, and associated activities impact and enhance the success of thousands that use mobility analysis with OSM every day.
