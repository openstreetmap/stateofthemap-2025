Teaching with OpenStreetMap has mostly been focused at the high school and undergraduate levels. In this presentation, I will share my experience of integrating OpenStreetMap into a professional graduate program, the Master of Geomatics for Environmental Management at the University of British Columbia. We will look at some of the opportunities for teaching with OpenStreetMap at the graduate-level, identify some of the challenges with teaching natural resource management with OpenStreetMap, and consider some broader implications for incorporating OpenStreetMap into graduate education. Finally, I will share some open educational resource lesson plans for teaching with OpenStreetMap that can be adapted for your classroom.
