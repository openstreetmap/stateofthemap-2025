What could you really accomplish with 100 days of consistent mapping? Add 1000 buildings, delete 100 nodes, or achieve completeness for an entire neighbourhood? Within the OpenStreetMap community, mappers contribute at different levels and frequencies using several tools and editors to enhance the map. In this presentation, we will share our experiences mapping every single day - the lessons learnt, the shortcuts we somehow didn't know, and key insights on maintaining data quality while sustaining a daily mapping practice over an extended period. We'll explore frameworks that could be considered for similar mapping challenges, strategies for finding motivation when inspiration runs low, and tracking progress to celebrate mapping milestones along the way.

Since February, I've implemented a daily OpenStreetMap contribution practice(inspired by community members in Tanzania who mapped daily in 2024!). This systematic approach to consistent mapping has provided valuable insights into both the technical and motivational aspects of sustained OSM engagement.

In this presentation, I will share my experiences mapping daily, examining how regular, incremental contributions can develop into meaningful map improvements over time. I'll discuss the variety of mapping tasks undertaken, the challenges encountered, and the quantifiable progression in mapping efficiency and quality.

The session will outline practical considerations for those interested in adopting a similar mapping routine, including time allocation strategies, approaches to maintaining engagement during challenging periods, and methods for evaluating contribution impact. The presentation will address how both brief daily sessions and more extended mapping periods can be effectively integrated into a sustainable practice.

This talk aims to present a structured framework for consistent OSM participation that attendees can adapt to their specific contexts, potentially enhancing both individual mapping capabilities and collective contributions to the OpenStreetMap project.
