In this extended session we want to discuss what motivates people to join the OpenStreetMap community and what makes them stay. Hear the stories of  Denis Kasozi, Bayazid Ahmed and Prativa Thapa, three of our community members coming from different backgrounds and countries. Then join our speakers and the session host Walter Mayeku in an extended QA session to share experiences how people come to be part of the contributors.

### Denis Kasozi: How OSM and YouthMappers Launched My Career in Geospatial Tech

This talk presents my personal journey as a case study on how OpenStreetMap (OSM) and YouthMappers can shape the lives and careers of young people especially in the Global South through practical learning, leadership opportunities, and global connections. I will share how I discovered OSM as a first-year university student in Uganda, joined the YouthMappers chapter at my university, and gradually grew into a leader and mentor within the community.

### Bayazid Ahmed: Navigating the World Through OpenStreetMap

I share my journey as a Computer Science student at Eastern University, Bangladesh, and the General Secretary of Eastern University YouthMappers, as I explore the impactful world of OpenStreetMap (OSM). My engagement with OSM began in May 2024 through participation in the OSMBD Mapathon. Since then, I have expanded my involvement by contributing to international mapathons, attending professional training sessions, and participating in global conferences such as State of the Map Asia 2024. Through these experiences, I have gained practical expertise in various open mapping tools, including JOSM, QGIS, and Overpass Turbo, and have earned multiple certifications along the way. My participation in the Open Mapping Guru Project has further strengthened my understanding of open data, community-driven mapping, and the application of geospatial information for humanitarian and development purposes. This paper aims to highlight how open mapping fosters collaboration, builds capacity, and contributes to the achievement of sustainable development goals. I also seek to encourage institutional recognition of open mapping as a powerful tool for education, civic engagement, and global problem-solving.

### Prativa Thapa: My Mission to Build Inclusive Mapping Communities in Nepal

Building a strong and inclusive mapping community requires leadership, collaboration and a vision that aligns with global geospatial initiatives. As an Om Guru Advanced Mapper, Kathmandu University YouthMappers President and Executive Member &amp; Sole Mapping Lead of Geomatics Engineering Society (GES) for tenure 2025, I have worked extensively to expand Nepalâ€™s OpenStreetMap (OSM) ecosystem, integrating engineering students, women and interdisciplinary contributors into mapping projects. My leadership has helped grow female mappers and transform the local community into university-level, being in the geospatial field, focused on women to lead mapping and running monthly campaigns across the country, ensuring greater inclusivity and technical engagement.
