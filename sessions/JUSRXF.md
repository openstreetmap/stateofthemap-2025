Not only NSI, but Wikidata can be integrated with OpenStreetMap, and vice versa! Many years ago, with the help of Wikidata Taiwan, OpenStreetMap Taiwan has mapped all 7,000 villages, and also cross-linked to Wikidata. We also have a similar river project of mapping all rivers in Taiwan and crosslinking to Wikidata with the help of the river code published by the Taiwan government. In this talk, we want to further talk about the school, mountain, church, temple, and hiking trail mapping projects, which also have the corresponding external 3rd-party Wikidata property. We will also describe the process like documenting and tools involved

NSI is quite an important project to cross-link OpenStreetMap and Wikidata, but the story can go further. With the help of the Wikidata Taiwan community, there are some achievements, like the rivers crosslinked (P9170), and the villages mapping and cross-linked (P5020). We also use Wikidata information to double check if the school's basic information, like address or website is correct or not, and adding its coordinates from OpenStreetMap geolocation.

The OpenStreetMap Taiwan continues to integrated more Wikidata and external identifier like religious related Chinese Church and Organization Dictionary ID(P13272) and Platform for Taiwan Religion and Folk Culture ID(P13349); hiking related identifier: Hiking Note Trail identifier(P13406), Hiking Note mountain identifier(P13407). 

We also use automatic approach to make sure both OpenStreetMap and Wikidata records all those entries and information. By the help of Listeria powered by OpenStreetMap, and the datamining  tools Overpass Turobo, to doing some documents and data check.
