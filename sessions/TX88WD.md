OpenStreetMap (OSM) has become one of the most valuable open mapping platforms, yet many aspiring contributors struggle with the initial learning curve. Technical complexities, lack of structured on boarding, and limited localized training resources often prevent new mappers from fully engaging with OSM. This talk will highlight key challenges faced by beginners and propose practical solutions to make OSM more accessible and inclusive.

Drawing from my experience as an Open Mapping Guru, a YouthMappers leader, and a trainer with the Open Mapping Hub - Asia Pacific, I will discuss effective strategies for on boarding new contributors. These include localized training resources, mentorship programs, and simplified tool introductions. By addressing these gaps, we can empower a more diverse community to participate actively in open mapping.

OpenStreetMap (OSM) is a powerful tool for open geographic data, yet many new contributors struggle with onboarding due to technical complexities, lack of structured training, and limited mentorship opportunities. These challenges hinder OSMâ€™s potential to grow into a truly inclusive and diverse mapping platform.

In this talk, I will address key barriers faced by beginners and present actionable solutions to enhance accessibility in OSM. Drawing from my experiences as an Open Mapping Guru, a YouthMappers leader, and a trainer with Open Mapping Hub - Asia Pacific, I will share strategies such as localized training materials, mentorship programs, gamification techniques, and social media engagement.

Through case studies of successful community-driven initiatives, including YouthMappers projects and grassroots mapping efforts in Bangladesh, I will demonstrate how we can empower new mappers and improve retention. By fostering a more beginner-friendly environment, we can ensure OSM remains a valuable resource for humanitarian efforts, disaster response, and everyday navigation.

Attendees will gain insights on practical ways to support new contributors in their communities and help make OSM more accessible, engaging, and sustainable.
