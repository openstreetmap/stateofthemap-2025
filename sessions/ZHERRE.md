This hands-on workshop will guide participants through the complete geospatial data pipeline, starting from drone imagery generation to processing high-precision imagery, generating building predictions using AI, and validating results via field mapping tools.
Participants will work through:
Setting up a drone mission to generate high precision imagery
Using OpenDroneMap (ODM) for imagery post-processing
Uploading results to OpenAerialMap
Applying fAIr to generate predicted buildings
Running a field mapping exercise using FMTM (Field Mapping Tasking Manager) and ODK


Participants will leave with the knowledge and open-source tools needed to replicate similar workflows in their own communities.
 Learning Objectives
By the end of this workshop, participants will:
Understand the components of a high-precision drone mapping setup
Learn how to plan drone flights using Drone Tasking Manager
Gain hands-on experience with ODM, OpenAerialMap, and fAIr
Practice setting up and using FMTM with custom GeoJSON extracts
Explore form configuration and field data collection via ODK / KoboCollect


Target Audience
Humanitarian mappers
drone pilots
Disaster response and planning teams
Educators, researchers, and technologists
Open-source mapping practitioners
