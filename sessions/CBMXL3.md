Whether you’re a simple mapper or a sophisticated data consumer, you depend on a lot of machinery at the heart of OpenStreetMap that you probably never think about. After many years mapping and tinkering on OSM-based frontend applications, Minh is venturing into the software core of OSM’s world. Join him as he recounts his travels, unearthing the many moving parts beneath the surface and piecing together how they fit into the larger constellation of OSM software. Get a glimpse of the future of this software stack as we invest in development resources and make progress on longstanding priorities – and how you can help.
