The Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) celebrates its 15th anniversary in 2025. This presentation will explore HOT's evolution from a small group of mappers responding to the Haiti earthquake to a global organization at the forefront of humanitarian mapping. We'll delve into key milestones, technological advancements, the growth of the HOT community, and the increasing role of local mappers in leading humanitarian responses. The talk will also address the challenges and opportunities for the next 15 years, including sustainability, technological innovation, and expanding the impact of open mapping in a changing world. This presentation will examine how HOT has transformed disaster response, development initiatives, and community empowerment through collaborative mapping.
