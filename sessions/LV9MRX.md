OpenStreetMap (OSM) thrives on teamwork and the desire to accurately depict the globe. Nonetheless, within its contributor base, gender disparities still exist. In addition to reflecting larger cultural trends, this underrepresentation affects the type of data gathered and the viewpoints given priority. 

Mappers, community organizers, and advocates get together on this topic to explore various aspects of gender in the OSM ecosystem. The workshop will highlight initiatives to promote diversity, talk about how cultural norms affect participation, and share personal experiences navigating gendered expectations. We will look into issues like: What are the ways in which mapping communities exhibit binary gender assumptions? What aspects of gender are influenced by linguistic and cultural contexts? In what ways can we establish environments that embrace a range of gender identities?

By examining these questions, the workshop aims to:
• Draw attention to the difficulties that underrepresented genders in OSM confront. 
• Discuss ways to encourage equal participation and combat gender biases. 
• Promote the use of inclusive terminology and methods in mapping projects. 

Those working on diversity projects, community participation, and the creation of mapping tools and policies may find this conversation very relevant. Participants will get knowledge about creating an OSM community that is more inclusive and celebrates the diversity of its members.
