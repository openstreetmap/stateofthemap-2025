In my several years of experience in my workplace at my university, this session will explore how OpenStreetMap (OSM) can be used in higher education to teach geography, GIS, and data science, providing hands-on experience with real-world data. I will share specific examples, such as student-led mapping projects that contributed to local community initiatives, and discuss how these projects enhanced students' technical skills and civic awareness. Additionally, I will address common challenges, such as data validation and student motivation, and present strategies to overcome them. Attendees will leave with practical strategies and resources to integrate OSM into their own teaching, including lesson plans, tool recommendations, and tips for managing student projects.

This session is designed for educators, researchers, and anyone interested in the intersection of open data and education. I will begin by providing an overview of how OSM can be a valuable tool in higher education, highlighting its benefits such as accessibility, real-world applicability, and community engagement. I will then delve into specific case studies from my experience as I am serving in Eastern University, Bangladesh.

In one case study, I will describe where students mapped underserved areas of the city, learning about data collection, tagging, and the importance of accurate mapping for navigation and emergency services. This project not only improved their mapping skills but also connected them with local non-profits, fostering a sense of social responsibility.

In another case study, I will discuss a session where students used OSM data to analyze urban development patterns. They learned about data sourcing, cleaning, and visualization, and presented their findings to city planners, gaining practical experience in applying geospatial analysis to real-world problems.
I will also explore the use of OSM in combination with other open-source tools, like QGIS and Python, to teach advanced topics in geospatial analysis. Additionally, I will share how online platforms and virtual collaborations have expanded the reach of OSM education, allowing students to participate in global mapping initiatives, such as mapping for humanitarian causes or contributing to regional mapping projects.
Furthermore, I will discuss the importance of connecting educational efforts with the broader OSM community. By collaborating with local OSM chapters and participating in events like Mapathons, students gain a deeper understanding of the collaborative nature of open mapping and the impact their contributions can have beyond the classroom.

However, integrating OSM into the curriculum is not without its challenges. Ensuring data quality, managing student contributions, and keeping students motivated are common issues. I will share strategies that have worked in my classes, such as implementing peer review systems, gamifying the mapping process, and connecting projects to real-world applications that matter to students.

The session will conclude with a Q&amp;A and discussion, where attendees can share their own experiences and ideas. My goal is to inspire educators to explore the potential of OSM in their teaching, providing them with the knowledge and resources to get started.
