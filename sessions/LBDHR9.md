Mangrove ecosystems are frontline defenders against climate change, yet data gaps hinder timely conservation. This research introduces a open mapping framework to detect and classify mangrove regeneration and degradation zones in the Sundarbans—one of the world’s largest mangrove forests. We fuse NDVI-based satellite analytics with OpenStreetMap (OSM) contributions and local validation to improve spatial accuracy. Our workflow strengthens OSM’s environmental data model and demonstrates how open-source mapping can guide climate adaptation, habitat restoration, and disaster risk planning. The study serves as a template for scaling environmental monitoring across other fragile coastal ecosystems.
