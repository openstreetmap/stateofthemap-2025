This talk presents my personal journey as a case study on how OpenStreetMap (OSM) and YouthMappers can shape the lives and careers of young people especially in the Global South through practical learning, leadership opportunities, and global connections. I will share how I discovered OSM as a first-year university student in Uganda, joined the YouthMappers chapter at my university, and gradually grew into a leader and mentor within the community.

Through mapping activities, training sessions, and fieldwork, I developed real-world GIS and data collection skills that I wouldn’t have learned in the classroom alone. YouthMappers gave me a platform not only to grow technically but also to gain leadership experience and become part of a vibrant global network of like-minded peers. These experiences opened doors: I received travel grants to attend mapping events in Ethiopia and Nairobi, where I met new people, broadened my perspective, and strengthened my commitment to open data.

After university, I continued volunteering with OpenStreetMap Uganda, where I was mentored and guided in how to contribute meaningfully to community-driven mapping. One of the most pivotal moments in my journey came when the Executive Director of OSM Uganda connected me to RippleNami Inc., a company working on a mapping project in The Gambia. What started as a short-term consultancy soon turned into a longer-term contract because of the skills and professionalism I brought skills I had learned entirely through my OSM and YouthMappers journey.

Today, I work as a Quality Assurance Tester at RippleNami, applying GIS knowledge daily to real-world problems. My career path is a direct result of the opportunities and mentorship I received through the open mapping community. This talk will show how platforms like YouthMappers and communities like OSM Uganda are not just training mappers they’re building careers and futures.

This session will appeal to students, community leaders, organizations, and anyone interested in how youth can engage with open data to gain valuable skills, unlock international opportunities, and make meaningful contributions to their communities. It’s also a call to invest more in youth mapping programs, mentorship, and open geospatial education across Africa and beyond.

This talk shares my personal story—one of many among the youth in Africa—whose lives have been transformed through involvement in OpenStreetMap (OSM) and YouthMappers. I joined YouthMappers during my first year at university in Uganda. What started as a curiosity about digital mapping quickly turned into a passion, a leadership opportunity, and a life-changing journey.

Key highlights of my journey:

Started as a student mapper, learning OSM editing, field data collection, and how open data works.

Became a YouthMappers club leader, helping train other students and organize local mapathons.

Attended international mapping events with travel grants—first to Ethiopia, then to Nairobi—expanding my network and vision.

After graduation, I began volunteering with OSM Uganda, where I received mentorship and was introduced to RippleNami Inc.

I was invited to support a mapping project in The Gambia, and after proving myself, I earned a long-term contract.

Today, I work as a Quality Assurance Tester, applying the GIS knowledge I gained through OSM and YouthMappers—without ever having studied formal GIS in school.

This talk will explore:

How early exposure to OSM builds practical, employable skills.

The power of student mapping communities (like YouthMappers) to train future geospatial professionals.

The importance of mentorship, volunteering, and community connections.

A call to support youth involvement in mapping for sustainable careers and global impact.

My story is just one example of how OSM isn’t just about maps—it’s a launchpad for young people, especially in the Global South, to access education, international networks, and professional growth.
