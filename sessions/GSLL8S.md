The UN Maps Programme, an initiative from the Department of Operational Support at the United Nations, provides topographic maps, operational geo-information, search and navigation tools, and imagery and street-level base maps to peacekeeping and humanitarian actors in UN mission areas. UN Maps has established a community of OpenStreetMap (OSM) data contributors called UN Mappers. The UN Mappers community is a collective of open mapping enthusiasts dedicated to building accurate and crowd-worked geospatial data to support peacekeeping and humanitarian missions on the ground.

The session aims to provide updates about the UN Maps programme and the UN Mappers community. In addition, we aim to share co-created and adopted initiatives that we are currently exploring in community building and sustainability, such as the UN Mappers Ambassadors and Chapters, and to discuss lessons learned and challenges.
