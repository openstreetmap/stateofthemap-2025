This hands-on workshop explores Mapillary and KartaView—two platforms for collecting and using street-level imagery to enhance OpenStreetMap. Participants will learn how to capture and upload imagery using smartphones or action cameras, compare platform features, and understand licensing, privacy, and community engagement considerations. We’ll demonstrate how each tool integrates with OSM editors for mapping features like bike lanes, traffic signages, and pedestrian infrastructure. Through practical exercises and local examples, attendees will gain skills to apply these tools in their own mapping initiatives and make informed decisions on which platform best supports their goals for civic and community mapping.
