Rare in Asia, house numbering grids are indeed present in the Philippines, as an analysis of
OpenStreetMap data shows.

In places like Bonifacio Global City the names of roads themselves form a quite advanced pattern,
with non-overlapping street vs. avenue numbering. House numbers are absent. Other places like Pasay
have odd numbered street names perpendicular to even.

If the physical streets form a grid, but the current numbers don't, then we take the liberty to
suggest one.

Software used: OGR/GDAL and GNU/Linux command line tools and Viking GPS to display the KMZs
produced.
