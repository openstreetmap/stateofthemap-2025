OSMlanduse is the first EU-wide 10 m land-use map integrating 3.2 million OpenStreetMap geometries with Sentinel-2 imagery through an open deep-learning workflow. Delivering CORINE-level thematic detail with finer spatial resolution, it achieves 89% accuracy, providinng wall-to-wall coverage while retaining OSMâ€™s sub-metre detail where available. Released under open licences with reproducible scripts, it supports applications from climate modelling and biodiversity surveys to urban planning and policy monitoring. By uniting crowdsourced mapping and Earth observation, OSMlanduse demonstrates a scalable, transparent approach to producing reliable, high-resolution land-use information at continental scale.
