During the OpenStreetMap Foundation Board Ask Us Anything (i.e. AMA) session, we will take questions from the audience oand/or more questions that the larger community can submit before the event. We can discuss the board's past actions and our future plans.

Let’s have a conversation about the Foundation and the Board and how all the parts work together. If you know nothing about what the board is doing, this is a chance to find out. Find out what the Foundation does and doesn’t do, what it can and can’t do. Find out how you can help and get involved. The Board is committed to openness and wants to engage with the community.

Feel free to ask us questions also outside this specific session.
