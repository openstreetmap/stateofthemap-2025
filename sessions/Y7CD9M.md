In today's digital mapping era, equipping students with practical GIS skills is essential. At The Institute of Survey &amp; Land Management, we have incorporated OpenStreetMap (OSM) and HOT Tasking Manager into our cartography curriculum to provide students with hands-on experience in open mapping. This integration not only enhances their technical skills but also exposes them to real-world geospatial data applications.

Why OSM and HOT Tasking Manager?
OSM provides an open and collaborative platform where students can contribute to mapping while learning essential cartographic principles. HOT Tasking Manager, on the other hand, allows for the structured coordination of mapping projects, making it a valuable tool for humanitarian and disaster response efforts. By using these tools, our students gain exposure to mapping workflows, data collection, and GIS applications in real-world scenarios.

Key Learning Areas in Our Curriculum

Our curriculum is designed to help students master the fundamentals of OSM while applying them in practical mapping exercises.
 
The following are some of the core components:
Mastering the OpenStreetMap Interface: Students start by creating an OSM account and familiarizing themselves with its basic interface. They learn how to navigate the OSM map, explore mapped features, and understand the tagging system.

Producing OpenStreetMap Data: Through guided exercises, students contribute to OSM by mapping buildings, roads, and other features. They use aerial imagery and field data to enhance mapping accuracy.

Adding Features Using iD Editor and JOSM: Hands-on training is provided for mapping using iD Editor, a web-based tool ideal for beginners. For advanced mapping, students learn to use JOSM (Java OpenStreetMap Editor), which offers more flexibility and editing capabilities.

Understanding the Role of HOT Tasking Manager: Students engage in coordinated mapping exercises using HOT Tasking Manager. They learn how mapping tasks are divided, validated, and used in humanitarian response efforts.

OSM Data Use Cases in Humanitarian and Economic Sectors: Case studies highlight how OSM data supports disaster response, urban planning, and economic development. Students explore how organizations use OSM for infrastructure planning, disease tracking, and crisis management.

Downloading and Integrating OSM Data in Academic Projects: Practical sessions involve downloading OSM data and using GIS software such as QGIS for analysis.
Students incorporate OSM data into research projects, applying spatial analysis techniques.
