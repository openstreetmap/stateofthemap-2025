This talk delves into the unique challenges and opportunities of enhancing OpenStreetMap (OSM) data for two-wheeler routing and safety. Two-wheelers are a vital mode of transportation within SEA, yet their safety needs are often overlooked. 

Drawing from our experience in building and contributing enriched safety data back to OSM, we explore how attributes like lighting conditions, speed bumps, and pothole assessments can make navigation safer and more efficient for two-wheelers.

Through this talk, we aim to inspire the OSM community to prioritize safety attributes for improving map data quality for two-wheelers.
