Dhaka, one of the most densely populated cities in the world, faces a high risk of catastrophic damage in the event of a major earthquake. The lack of accessible open spaces poses a serious challenge for emergency evacuation and survival. This project utilizes OpenStreetMap (OSM) road and building layers, combined with satellite imagery, to identify existing open spaces across the city. Using ArcGIS, a routing model was developed to guide individuals to their nearest safe zone during an earthquake. This approach demonstrates how open-source geospatial data and GIS tools can be leveraged for disaster preparedness in high-risk areas.
