EUthMappers is an ERASMUS+ initiative that promotes STEAM education in secondary schools throughout the European Union, enhancing students' digital skills and fostering environmental civic engagement. The project includes three universities, students and teachers from five European schools, working for two years. The project has three main phases: development of training materials, local mapping projects and humanitarian mapping collaboration. This presentation outlines the project's implementation steps and showcases the remarkable results achieved by not only participating students but also organizers.
