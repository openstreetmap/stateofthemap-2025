In this 60-minute workshop, I will share my approach and personal workflow in managing remote mapping projects using the HOT Tasking Manager. Tailored for those with Project Manager access, yet open to all, the session aims to highlight real-world methods of setting up priority areas with limited ground data, responding effectively to volunteer feedback, and writing clear, actionable task instructions. I will also present an idea for forming temporary validator teams (not yet implemented), and openly share the challenges and pain points Iâ€™ve faced in these roles. The workshop is not about presenting a perfect solution, but about learning together and collecting ideas for continuous improvement.

This workshop shares practical insights from managing remote mapping projects in the HOT Tasking Manager, specifically from the perspective of a fellow with project manager access. It is open to all, especially those curious about behind-the-scenes decision-making. Topics include
- setting mapping priorities with limited on-the-ground data,
- writing effective project instructions,
- responding to contributor feedback, and
- proposing new ideas like forming temporary validator teams.
- It also reflects on personal pain points and lessons learned in the process.

Rather than claiming best practices, this session invites discussion and shared learning to improve how we manage collaborative mapping for humanitarian and development goals.
