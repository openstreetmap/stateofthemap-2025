**Turn OpenStreetMap data into routing insights** with openrouteservice and QGIS, no servers, no sign-ups, no code.

In this 90-minute hands-on session **for newcomers and intermediates**, you’ll:
- See **how OSM tags become a routable network** and why popular routing engines offer directions, isochrones &amp; matrices per default and what they do.
- Connect the **ORS-Tools QGIS-plugin** with the public openrouteservice API with **API-keys we hand out on the spot**.
- **Build multiprofile routes** around the SotM venue, **calculate hospital service areas** in Manila, and **solve a medicine delivery** to every of those hospitals **with** the help of easy to access **vehicle optimisation**.

You’ll walk away with a **reusable QGIS project**, a **tutorial**, and the confidence and knowledge to **repeat the workflow anywhere, anytime**.

<hr>

This 90-minute workshop is a hands-on session for newcomers and intermediates to learn how to do routing and mobility analysis with OSM data and openrouteservice in QGIS.

We start with a **fast-but-thorough introduction** with the basics for the new ones: 
- How are **OSM tags** converted into routable networks; 
- How do you **access OSM data for mobility analysis**;
- The **three core services of routing engines**: directions, isochrones, matrix. 

During the hands-on part, you'll learn how to use the ORS-Tools QGIS-plugin for rapid prototyping, and how it brings all of this power of mobility analysis straight into QGIS without any server setup or complicated requirements.

More specific you will:

- **connect the ORS-Tools plugin** to the public ORS API using **workshop API-keys we provide – no signup needed**;
- **build turn-by-turn routes** around the SotM 2025 venue;
- calculate X-minute hospital isochrones in Manila and count the residents they cover;
- **solve a travelling-salesman problem** to deliver medicine to every of those hospitals in the most efficient way.

You’ll leave with a ready-to-reuse QGIS project and the know-how to repeat every step anywhere and anytime. The participants can always set up openrouteservice as self-hosted or acquire individual access to our hosted servers for free afterwards.
