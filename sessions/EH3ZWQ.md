This talk explores the extrinsic quality of OpenStreetMap data in Brno by comparing the city’s most frequently mapped amenities against a custom, field-collected reference dataset. The findings highlight relatively high attribute accuracy in OSM but reveal gaps in feature completeness, with only about 34.94% of features matched with the reference dataset.
