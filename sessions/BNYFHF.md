In this work we develop a reproducible pipeline for querying multiple LLMs/chatbots in order to access and analyse their opinion on OpenStreetMap by prompting these systems to answer a series of questions on OSM.  People are turning to chatbots and LLMs for opinions and advice on practically every topic. We believe it is important that we begin to assess how chatbots and the LLMs provide information and opinion about OSM. Among other outputs, this work can providing evidence to the OSM community that can be used to shape future public engagement strategies about the project.
