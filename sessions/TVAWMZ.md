This hands-on workshop is designed for beginners who are curious about Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and want to explore the power of open-source mapping through QGIS. Participants will be introduced to the fundamentals of GIS, the QGIS interface, and basic tools for creating, editing, and visualizing spatial data. The session will include a practical component where attendees will carry out a simple mapping task using real-world datasets. Whether you're a student, researcher, development professional, or simply GIS-curious, this workshop will equip you with the foundational skills to start your own mapping journey. No prior GIS experience required—just bring your curiosity!

This one-hour introductory workshop is tailored for individuals who are new to Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and want to learn how to use QGIS—a powerful, open-source GIS software. Whether you are a student, researcher, NGO practitioner, development worker, or a curious learner, this session will demystify the basics of spatial thinking and equip you with the skills to start mapping confidently.

The session will begin with a short, interactive presentation covering the core concepts of GIS, such as spatial data types, map layers, coordinate systems, and the role of GIS in decision-making across sectors. Participants will then be guided through the QGIS interface, learning how to add vector and raster layers, apply symbology, and perform simple spatial queries.

The highlight of the session will be a hands-on practical exercise, where participants will use publicly available datasets to create a basic thematic map (e.g., population density, land use, or service accessibility). By the end of the workshop, attendees will be able to:

- Understand the purpose and potential of GIS in real-world applications

- Navigate QGIS and access basic tools for visualization and analysis

- Create and export a map layout with legends, scale, and titles

- Access free resources for continued learning after the session

No prior GIS experience is needed. Participants are encouraged to bring their own laptops with QGIS installed (installation instructions will be shared beforehand).
