We want to share what we have learned: the challenges and contributions during this process, and how we plan to continue. \r\n\r\nOSMTracker is one of the oldies free software data capture tools in the OSM ecosystem.  Its simplicity, low technical requirements, easy customization, and ability to use the exported data in various applications make it a valuable resource for mappers. The app became part of the methodological resources used by the Laboratorio Experimental de Computaci\u00f3n y Comunidades (LabCom\u00fan) for development of university extension projects together with communities like Erizo Juan Santamar\u00eda Informal settlements and Alajuela en Cleta urban cycling collective. Naturally, the usage of OSMTracker in this context showed us improvements needed in the app, and consequently, we contributed with code that were incorporated in the tool. \r\n\r\nIn 2018, nguillaumin, the original developer of the app, transferred the maintenance OSMTracker to LabCom\u00fan. Since then, LabCom\u00fan has been managing the challenge of developing free software from a (global south) public university: scarcity of resources, bureaucratic difficulties, and how to align the process of developing software while offering a sustainable educational experience for students.\r\n\r\nThe ongoing focus of development of OSMTracker highlights the importance of engagement of undergrad computer science students in projects that are related to territories and people. This offers a real perspective on how their contributions to software could improve the quality of life. From a technical and academic perspective, the opportunity to be part of a bigger free software and open data community is unique.\r\n\r\nFinally, we want to open discussion on how to enhance the sustainability of OSMTracker, involving other actors in collaborations and keeping the app useful for thematic mapping projects.", "speakers": ["MC3GN8", "PQBBQU"], "track": 5521, "start": "2025-10-03T14:30:00+08:00", "end": "2025-10-03T14:50:00+08:00", "room": 4376, "duration": 20, "updated": "2025-06-13T12:38:12.455076+00:00", "state": null, "do_not_record": null}, {"code": "TVAWMZ", "id": 1218686, "title": "Getting Started with QGIS: A Beginner's Guide to Mapping with Open-Source Tools", "abstract": "This hands-on workshop is designed for beginners who are curious about Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and want to explore the power of open-source mapping through QGIS.

While the ecosystem once thrived on regionally supported events and student-led enthusiasm, it now faces a rise in passive contributors and a lack of continuity in mapping efforts. This trend is particularly concerning in a context like Nepal, where access to reliable and up-to-date geospatial data remains limited, and OSM presents a valuable, open-source alternative for inclusive mapping and data democratisation. A key factor contributing to this decline is the narrow framing of OSM as a repetitive editing platform, often reinforced by conventional training sessions that overlook the broader creative and applied potential of the tool. Innovative and accessible platforms such as Mapillary, MapSwipe, and OSM-based design tools\u2014which can make mapping more engaging and relevant to everyday challenges\u2014are rarely introduced or integrated into learning experiences. Drawing on my own experience organising initiatives such as the OSM Hackfest and thematic map design based on OSM dataset competitions, I have witnessed how student engagement can be restored when OSM is presented not just as an editing tool but as a gateway to problem-solving in urban planning, disaster resilience, and many more potentials of the OSM datasets.

These programs not only equip participants with valuable skills but also nurture a sense of ownership and agency in managing their environment. The integration of emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning enhances data accuracy and analysis, facilitating better planning for disaster risk reduction, infrastructure development, and natural resource management.\r\n\r\nDrawing on specific case studies from rural flood-prone villages to urban areas engaging university youth through YouthMappers chapters, and successful examples of community collaboration, capacity building, and the use of tools like QGIS, Overpass API, and AI-powered satellite imagery analysis.

Community members collaborated in mapping key WASH-related assets, including water points, sanitation facilities, and waste collection sites, enabling a detailed spatial understanding often absent in official datasets.\r\nA three-stage methodology was applied: participatory asset mapping, field validation using SurveyCTO , and data digitization and uploading onto OpenStreetMap.
