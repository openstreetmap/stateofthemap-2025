      "abstract": "OpenStreetMap and games feel like they go hand-in-hand and that's more than just coincidental. Both OSM and gaming have the power to bring people together, foster community engagement, and provide unique experiences. \r\n\r\nIn fact, the OSM wiki has a page for games built using OSM data (https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Games) and in recent years, we've seen the increase in the use of tools such as MapRoulette and StreetComplete that gamify the experience of contributing to OSM. While the latter is a very interesting topic in itself, this talk will focus on the former—games that use, but are not necessarily intended to contribute, OSM data.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will explore the world of OSM-based/OSM-adjacent games to try and identify various game categories/genres and uses of OSM such as in location-based games (e.g. PokemonGO), serious and realistic simulation games, educational and trivia games, other niche/bespoke games, as well as both digital and tangible/tactile experiences.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, we will try to investigate the benefits and drawbacks of using OSM in games and look into other open source \"games/game resources/gaming communities\" (such as those in the Open Source Tabletop/RPG genre) to uncover possible intersections and opportunities.\r\n\r\nWhether you're a beginner or experienced OSM contributor, a game developer, or just a fellow gamer, this talk aims to spark new ideas and inspire further discussions, activities, and developments around the intersection of OpenStreetMap and games.",

      "abstract": "Between September 2024 and August 2025, we conducted a comprehensive street-level survey of Milano, Italy, capturing approximately one million 360° panoramic images using a monopod-mounted camera setup. These images were uploaded to Mapillary, contributing to open-access urban geospatial data. This presentation shares practical insights into continuous data collection methods and analyzes urban characteristics discernible from the imagery, such as graffiti prevalence, urban greenery distribution, and the potential of these visuals as foundational data for 3D digital twin models. I will discuss the current capabilities and limitations of using crowdsourced street-level imagery for urban analysis and planning.",

      "abstract": "This is a story about the last 7 years of OSMTracker and how, from an academic space in a Costa Rican public university, we managed to keep alive the app with computer engineering undergrad students.  We want to share what we have learned: the challenges and contributions during this process, and how we plan to continue. \r\n\r\nOSMTracker is one of the oldies free software data capture tools in the OSM ecosystem.  Its simplicity, low technical requirements, easy customization, and ability to use the exported data in various applications make it a valuable resource for mappers. The app became part of the methodological resources used by the Laboratorio Experimental de Computación y Comunidades (LabComún) for development of university extension projects together with communities like Erizo Juan Santamaría Informal settlements and Alajuela en Cleta urban cycling collective. Naturally, the usage of OSMTracker in this context showed us improvements needed in the app, and consequently, we contributed with code that were incorporated in the tool. \r\n\r\nIn 2018, nguillaumin, the original developer of the app, transferred the maintenance OSMTracker to LabComún. Since then, LabComún has been managing the challenge of developing free software from a (global south) public university: scarcity of resources, bureaucratic difficulties, and how to align the process of developing software while offering a sustainable educational experience for students.\r\n\r\nThe ongoing focus of development of OSMTracker highlights the importance of engagement of undergrad computer science students in projects that are related to territories and people. This offers a real perspective on how their contributions to software could improve the quality of life. From a technical and academic perspective, the opportunity to be part of a bigger free software and open data community is unique.\r\n\r\nFinally, we want to open discussion on how to enhance the sustainability of OSMTracker, involving other actors in collaborations and keeping the app useful for thematic mapping projects.",

      "abstract": "Dhaka, one of the most climate-affected cities in South Asia, is home to millions of migrants living in informal urban settlements. These densely populated areas are increasingly exposed to environmental and health hazards, particularly seasonal waterlogging and recurring dengue outbreaks. Despite the severity of these issues, many of these settlements remain underrepresented in official datasets, limiting the ability to implement targeted and effective resilience measures.\r\n\r\nAs part of our Capstone Project under the Climate Resilience Fellowship (CRF), this initiative leveraged OpenStreetMap (OSM) to conduct a community-led, GIS-based multi-hazard assessment in some of Dhaka’s most climate-vulnerable settlements. Our work followed a two-phase approach:\r\n\r\nField-based data collection and mapping, where youth and women from local communities actively identified water accumulation zones and dengue breeding hotspots using OSM tools.\r\n\r\nAwareness building and local preparedness activities, using the mapped data to facilitate community dialogues and promote action for health and disaster resilience.\r\n\r\nThrough this participatory mapping effort, we not only generated critical geospatial data but also strengthened local capacity to respond to climate and health risks. OSM served as both a data platform and a tool for empowerment, enabling residents to visualize their vulnerabilities and advocate for solutions.\r\n\r\nThis talk will showcase how open mapping, when integrated with community engagement and local knowledge, can effectively support disaster risk reduction, public health planning, and climate adaptation in marginalized urban areas. We will also reflect on the potential for replicating this model in other cities facing similar climate and health challenges.",

      "abstract": "Nepal’s OpenStreetMap (OSM) community is currently experiencing a noticeable decline in active participation and long-term engagement. While the ecosystem once thrived on regionally supported events and student-led enthusiasm, it now faces a rise in passive contributors and a lack of continuity in mapping efforts. This trend is particularly concerning in a context like Nepal, where access to reliable and up-to-date geospatial data remains limited, and OSM presents a valuable, open-source alternative for inclusive mapping and data democratisation. A key factor contributing to this decline is the narrow framing of OSM as a repetitive editing platform, often reinforced by conventional training sessions that overlook the broader creative and applied potential of the tool. Innovative and accessible platforms such as Mapillary, MapSwipe, and OSM-based design tools—which can make mapping more engaging and relevant to everyday challenges—are rarely introduced or integrated into learning experiences. Drawing on my own experience organising initiatives such as the OSM Hackfest and thematic map design based on OSM dataset competitions, I have witnessed how student engagement can be restored when OSM is presented not just as an editing tool but as a gateway to problem-solving in urban planning, disaster resilience, and many more potentials of the OSM datasets. More importantly, there is a need for advocacy for a shift in narrative: from simply contributing data to understanding the importance of OSM and utilising it. By embedding OSM awareness from the student level to policymaking stakeholders, Nepal can foster a resilient and self-sustaining mapping ecosystem.",

      "abstract": "OpenStreetMap (OSM) is the most comprehensive open-source geospatial database in the world—but as it continues to grow, the tools for understanding and managing this data need to evolve as well. In this workshop, we explore how AI, when thoughtfully integrated with OSM workflows, can offer intelligent, context-aware support to mappers and developers alike.\r\n\r\nThis session introduces participants to the Model Context Protocol (MCP)—a lightweight, structured format for embedding task-specific context into AI interactions. MCP allows for the creation of prompts and workflows that are reproducible, local-first, and aware of the mapping domain. Using this protocol, we will build a proof-of-concept tool that uses open-source large language models (LLMs) to interpret OSM data and assist with mapping tasks, such as tag validation, feature classification, and geospatial query answering.\r\n\r\nImportantly, the workshop focuses on privacy-respecting, open-source solutions. All AI tools used will run locally on participant machines, avoiding any reliance on commercial APIs or user-tracking platforms. This aligns with the ethos of the OSM and open-data communities, ensuring participants can experiment with powerful AI without compromising control or transparency.\r\n\r\nAttendees will gain practical skills in working with Overpass API to extract OSM data, creating MCP-compliant prompts, running local LLMs via tools like LM Studio or Ollama, and designing AI agents that enhance mapping workflows. No prior experience with AI is required—just a curiosity for what happens when maps meet models.",

      "abstract": "This talk introduces a student-led initiative from the Furuhashi Lab at Aoyama Gakuin University in Japan, focusing on the localization of global open mapping knowledge. As a YouthMappers chapter, we are currently translating the open-access book Open Mapping towards Sustainable Development Goals into Japanese. The aim of this translation project is to make critical mapping knowledge accessible to non-English-speaking students and to encourage greater participation in the open mapping community.\r\n\r\nRecognizing the importance of engaging peers through action, we organized our first online Mapathon in early 2025. This event helped beginner mappers gain hands-on experience and fostered a sense of community among participants. Building on its success, we are now planning a collaborative inter-university Mapathon scheduled for July 2025, with the goal of expanding our network and impact across academic institutions in Japan.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will share insights from managing the translation workflow, including how we divided chapters, ensured consistency in technical vocabulary, and utilized collaborative tools such as GitHub for version control. We will also reflect on our outreach efforts—how we communicated the value of open mapping to our peers and engaged them in both the translation and mapping processes.\r\n\r\nThrough this project, we aim to empower students with the knowledge and tools needed to contribute to global development goals through geospatial technologies. Ultimately, our initiative highlights the potential of youth-driven efforts to strengthen open mapping education and build inclusive communities, even in regions where English is not the primary language.",

      "abstract": "The open mapping movement in Sri Lanka has gained significant traction in recent years, with grassroots organizations demonstrating how open geospatial technologies can serve as tools for advocacy, resilience, and participatory governance. Supported by the Vriddhi Project, implemented by UNOPS Sri Lanka, this initiative introduced OpenStreetMap (OSM) and complementary open-source geospatial tools to 113 civil society organizations (CSOs) in Sri Lanka. These CSOs represented diverse sectors including women’s rights, land rights, environmental protection, youth development and disaster risk reduction.\r\n\r\nThe approach was structured around four pillars. Initiation and Engagement examined how the unfamiliar concept of open mapping was contextualized in local languages, building trust and digital confidence among grassroots actors. Capacity Building and Toolkits focused on the design of non-technical training modules and the deployment of user-friendly tools that directly informed local advocacy. Challenges and Lessons Learned highlighted issues of digital inequality, connectivity gaps, institutional skepticism, and gendered barriers to participation, while also reflecting on strategies to sustain momentum in remote and conflict-affected areas. Outcomes and Impact showcased case studies, including mapping project outcomes, visualizing land disputes, and documenting community assets, demonstrating how open mapping enhanced transparency, collaboration, and storytelling across civil society initiatives.\r\n\r\nBy embedding open mapping practices into grassroots workflows, this project illustrates the transformative potential of locally driven geospatial innovation. It further underscores the critical role of civil society in advancing open data ecosystems and sustaining participatory development in South Asia.",

In addition to reflecting larger cultural trends, this underrepresentation affects the type of data gathered and the viewpoints given priority. \r\n\r\nMappers, community organizers, and advocates get together on this topic to explore various aspects of gender in the OSM ecosystem. The workshop will highlight initiatives to promote diversity, talk about how cultural norms affect participation, and share personal experiences navigating gendered expectations. We will look into issues like: What are the ways in which mapping communities exhibit binary gender assumptions? What aspects of gender are influenced by linguistic and cultural contexts? In what ways can we establish environments that embrace a range of gender identities?\r\n\r\nBy examining these questions, the workshop aims to:\r\n• Draw attention to the difficulties that underrepresented genders in OSM confront. \r\n• Discuss ways to encourage equal participation and combat gender biases. \r\n• Promote the use of inclusive terminology and methods in mapping projects. \r\n\r\nThose working on diversity projects, community participation, and the creation of mapping tools and policies may find this conversation very relevant. Participants will get knowledge about creating an OSM community that is more inclusive and celebrates the diversity of its members.",

As an Om Guru Advanced Mapper, Kathmandu University YouthMappers President and Executive Member & Sole Mapping Lead of Geomatics Engineering Society (GES) for tenure 2025, I have worked extensively to expand Nepal’s OpenStreetMap (OSM) ecosystem, integrating engineering students, women and interdisciplinary contributors into mapping projects. My leadership has helped grow female mappers and transform the local community into university-level, being in the geospatial field, focused on women to lead mapping and running monthly campaigns across the country, ensuring greater inclusivity and technical engagement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               In April 2025, I single-handedly organized Mapping Week 2025, an open mapping initiative held across Kathmandu University. This program featured 9 distinct open-source mapping applications, more than 12 national and international trainers and a range of community engagement activities including mapathons, quizzes and interactive workshops. The result? A historic rise in female participation and the expansion of mapping interest across university that previously had little exposure to OSM.\r\nMy talk focuses on how OpenStreetMap can be a tool for technical training, empowerment, inclusion and leadership development. I will reflect on the process of forming KU YouthMappers, expanding beyond a departmental club into a university-wide, multidisciplinary chapter. I will also explore challenges we faced when breaking academic silos, how we sustained motivation among new mappers and strategies that ensured our efforts aligned with OSMF’s larger mission.\r\nThis session will demonstrate building inclusive and gender-aware communities using open tools like ID editors and JOSM. It also aims to show the potential of young leaders, especially women, in shaping the future of mapping movements in underrepresented regions like Nepal. My ultimate goal is to highlight how ‘Women Who Map’ can be pioneers of change both locally and globally.",

By leveraging open-source tools and OpenStreetMap (OSM) data, state of map participants will learn how to analyze urban sprawl, forecast future building space needs, and evaluate trends in urban development and planning control.\r\nUrban sprawl, characterized by uncontrolled city expansion, poses major challenges for sustainable development. Through spatial analysis, visualization, and modeling using tools like OSM, QGIS and spatial statistics, participants can identify growth hotspots, assess building density patterns, and measure the Urban Sprawl Index. The session also covers forecasting techniques using historical data and scenario modeling to project building demand and align infrastructure development with population trends.\r\nFurthermore, GIS tools will be applied to evaluate long-term development trends, monitor the effectiveness of urban policies, and assess the environmental impact of expansion. Attendees will explore practical steps for implementation, including data collection strategies, interdepartmental collaboration, and stakeholder engagement. This session demonstrates how open data ecosystems like OSM and GIS can empower governments to make informed, future-oriented urban planning decisions",

These images provided an opportunity to compare the situation before and after the disaster and to assess the damage to thousands of buildings. The presentation will explain the chosen methodology, which was inspired by the few examples previously produced in OSM and by a methodology developed by researchers at the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative. It will briefly show the editing workflow, which uses a specific preset and cartographic style in JOSM and relies on detailed descriptions and videos in several languages. It will also analyze the results obtained and the statistics generated throughout the cartographic process. It will compare them with other post-Chido evaluations carried out remotely or in the field, but on smaller samples. Finally, it will look at the prospects for replication in other contexts affected by wind damage.",

Drawing from the Asia-Pacific Open Mapping Hub’s 2025–2030 Community Building Strategy, this session will present pathways for local leadership, inclusive participation, and cross-border collaboration. Participants will unpack the strategy’s key objectives—such as strengthening grassroots mapping, integrating community-centered monitoring and evaluation (MEL), and scaling open mapping through partnerships—and localize these goals through the lens of their own communities.\r\n\r\nUsing interactive frameworks, reflection tools, and real-world examples, the workshop will help Gurus:\r\n\r\n1) Identify their unique leadership role and local impact potential\r\n2) Map opportunities for growing their local communities or projects\r\n3) Align their ongoing work with regional strategy goals\r\n4) Collaborate with other Gurus and partners to solve shared challenges\r\n\r\nBy the end of this session, Gurus will leave with a clearer roadmap of how their grassroots work fits into a broader open mapping movement—where their contributions are seen, supported, and celebrated. This is not just a workshop; it's an invitation to step more confidently into your leadership role within the open mapping ecosystem.",

For many local communities, proper representation of the native language is just as important as getting the locations right. OpenHistoricalMap extends this approach back in time, incidentally tracking the evolution of written language through toponyms. Increasingly, users experience both projects through vector maps, which cannot necessarily benefit from the techniques that enable broad language support in raster maps. In particular, many Asian writing systems present unique implementation challenges for both cartographers and renderer developers.\r\n\r\nThis talk traces the history of writing system support in one popular vector map library, MapLibre, from its origins in Mapbox GL to more recent experiments in improving text layout and rendering. As vector map technology finds its way onto the OSM homepage, these improvements will take on added urgency. You’ll learn about some mapping practices that renderer developers must work around, as well as limitations in underlying technologies like JavaScript and Unicode that block more comprehensive language coverage. You’ll come away with a fuller appreciation for the role of text rendering technology on the Web in the promotion of linguistic heritage.",

Within the OpenStreetMap community, mappers contribute at different levels and frequencies using several tools and editors to enhance the map. In this presentation, we will share our experiences mapping every single day - the lessons learnt, the shortcuts we somehow didn't know, and key insights on maintaining data quality while sustaining a daily mapping practice over an extended period. We'll explore frameworks that could be considered for similar mapping challenges, strategies for finding motivation when inspiration runs low, and tracking progress to celebrate mapping milestones along the way.",

      "abstract": "Access to safe water and sanitation is critical for public health and sustainable urban development, yet significant disparities persist in informal settlements across low- and middle-income countries. This study explores inequalities in WASH access within Korogocho and Viwandani which are two densely populated informal settlements in Nairobi, using a participatory geospatial approach. Community members collaborated in mapping key WASH-related assets, including water points, sanitation facilities, and waste collection sites, enabling a detailed spatial understanding often absent in official datasets.\r\nA three-stage methodology was applied: participatory asset mapping, field validation using SurveyCTO , and data digitization and uploading onto OpenStreetMap. The process not only improved data quality but also empowered and built capacity of local residents through engagement in data collection and urban planning discussions.\r\nResults revealed critical service gaps, facility unreliability, and infrastructure needs, particularly during droughts. Despite Nairobi’s reported high access levels to improved water (96.4%), this figure masks deep inequalities within its informal settlements. By identifying priority areas and visualizing spatial inequalities, participatory GIS offers a scalable model for inclusive planning and equitable WASH interventions. This research underscores the role of community-driven mapping in fostering sustainable urban resilience and informing policy for underserved populations.",

The silhouette score for PCA-based clustering was 0.951. The results show superior interpretability of KMeans over HDBSCAN. This repeatable methodology provides a scalable and reference-free solution to take quality assurance of VGI datasets to the front-line, in cases of limited or no authoritative data.",

      "abstract": "Dhaka, one of the most densely populated cities in the world, faces a high risk of catastrophic damage in the event of a major earthquake. The lack of accessible open spaces poses a serious challenge for emergency evacuation and survival. This project utilizes OpenStreetMap (OSM) road and building layers, combined with satellite imagery, to identify existing open spaces across the city. Using ArcGIS, a routing model was developed to guide individuals to their nearest safe zone during an earthquake. This approach demonstrates how open-source geospatial data and GIS tools can be leveraged for disaster preparedness in high-risk areas.",

People are turning to chatbots and LLMs for opinions and advice on practically every topic. We believe it is important that we begin to assess how chatbots and the LLMs provide information and opinion about OSM. Among other outputs, this work can providing evidence to the OSM community that can be used to shape future public engagement strategies about the project.",
