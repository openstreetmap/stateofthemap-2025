Did you miss the call for general and OSM Science presentations? Fret not! You can still present your project and initiatives at State of the Map 2025! The Call  for Posters for SotM 2025 is now open!

Your poster could show how well your community is mapped. It could be a new beautiful style or a map. It  could be a community project or statistics, or a poster explaining and inviting people to OpenStreetMap. The important thing is that it is about OSM. We also welcome academic posters on research around OpenStreetMap data.

For inspiration, you can check out the [SotM 2024 posters](https://2022.stateofthemap.org/posters/).
