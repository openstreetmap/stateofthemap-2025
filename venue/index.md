Manila, short for the Metro Manila area (which includes both Quezon City and Manila City), is home to at least 16 million people within its  officially-defined metropolitan area, is not only the capital of the  Philippines, but also a major center of commerce, culture, education and  government in Southeast Asia. Long a crossroads between East and West,  Manila is a melting pot of both Oriental and Western cultures, with  Southeast Asian, Chinese, Spanish and American influences leaving their  own distinct marks on the city and its people. Famous for its sunsets,  Manila is known for its mix of old and new, the friendliness of its  people and, most importantly, its hospitality. And we wish to extend  that hospitality to OpenStreetMap enthusiasts from all over the world by  bringing State of the Map here to the Philippines.

## Language

The official languages in the Philippines are Filipino/Tagalog and English. In Manila, most people communicate in Filipino and English.

## Weather

The Philippines is a tropical country. It has relatively high temperature, high humidity and abundant rainfall. Manila generally experiences a dry season from December to May and a wet/rainy season from June to November. It is recommended to prepare for dry and rainy days and to check the weather before travelling.

NAIA is the country’s busiest  airport serving over 40 million passengers annually (before the  pandemic) and has numerous direct flights to various cities in Asia,  Australasia, and North America.

The secondary airport for Metro Manila is Clark International Airport  (IATA: CRK), located 85 kilometers north of Manila in Angeles  City, Pampanga. Clark serves as a hub for various local and foreign  low-cost carriers and is reachable from Manila by numerous  point-to-point commercial bus services.

<h1 id="pt">Moving around</h1>

The Metro Manila  area has a large availability of  public transport options: local tricycles, jeepneys, buses, and light  rails. Other private services such as taxis and ride-sharing apps (Grab,  Angkas, etc.) are also available at a higher cost. Check pamasahe.club  to know the updated “pamasahe” or transportation fare. By Buses/Jeep: Metro Manila has an extensive bus/jeep network that  serves almost all primary to secondary level roads. Quezon City can be  accessed by most buses. Fares are distance-based. By Rail Metro Manila is served by 3 light rail routes: the LRT-1, LRT-2,  and MRT-3. While there is no direct access from the airport, buses  along the EDSA Carousel loop share the same stops with the MRT-3.

By Taxi: Right from the airport, there are taxi stands available if  you opt for their service. Taxis charge a flag down rate of ₱40 that  increases with travel time and distance. Coupon taxis cost more as they  charge a flat-rate to go to any point as listed in their matrix but are  more cost-efficient for larger groups.

Ride-share apps: Download the leading ride-sharing app, Grab, to access  the multiple services they offer including ride-sharing and deliveries.  Other apps for traveling around are Angkas (motorcycle), JoyRide  (motorcycle and car), and Sakay.ph for public commute directions.

Suggested commuter route (UPD): Take the UBE Express bus (see bus  schedule here) from the NAIA Terminal 3 to Araneta City-Cubao. Board the  MRT-3 train (check your route here) at Araneta-Cubao Station and alight  at North Avenue Station. Walk through Trinoma and SM North EDSA malls  and find the terminal for jeepneys going to UPD. Estimated price: UBE  Express (₱200/$3.6) + MRT (₱16/$0.30) + Jeep (₱15/$0.30) = ₱231/$4.2

Suggested private car route (UPD): From NAIA, you can travel through  EDSA following the avenue and turning right on Quezon Avenue towards the  Quezon Memorial Circle. Take the exit to Commonwealth Avenue then turn  right towards the UPD sign. Alternatively, you can take the Skyway  highway system (tolled road) exiting at Quezon Avenue and continuing as  directed above.
